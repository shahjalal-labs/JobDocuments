We are excited to develop this further and see if we can help more open-source projects build performant and accessible interfaces that respond well to diverse layouts. We use REST APIs for communication, and we consider API design an important part of the process.

We deliver open source to the world faster, more securely and more cost effectively than any other company.

We're also the publishers of Ubuntu, the world’s most popular enterprise Linux from cloud to edge, together with a passionate global community of 200,000+ contributors.

Ubuntu means 'humanity to others'​. We chose it because it embodies the generosity at the heart of open source, the new normal for platforms and innovation.

Together with a community of 200,000, we publish an operating system that runs from the tiny connected devices up to the world's biggest mainframes, the platform that everybody uses on the public cloud, and the workstation experience of the world's most productive developers.

Secure and reliable, elegant and intuitive, and open for innovation - this is the future of open source, which is why we're proud to be the developers of the fastest growing Linux in the world despite already being the most widely deployed.

If you're interested in a career at Canonical, we are a remote-first company so please apply to any suitable role as skills are valued more than location, despite some having a preferred geographic preference.
